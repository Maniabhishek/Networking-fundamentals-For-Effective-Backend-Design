- what is idempotent
  - An idempotent HTTP method is one that produces the same result on the server no matter how many times it is called.

 
### Idempotent Methods in HTTP
- GET ✅
- PUT ✅
- DELETE ✅
- HEAD ✅
- OPTIONS ✅
- POST ❌ (Not Idempotent)
- PATCH ❌ (Not Always Idempotent)


### why to use seperate methods for different work , if we can do delete using get also 
1. Clarity & Readability
Each method explicitly describes the action being performed.
Example:
GET /users/123 → Clearly means retrieving user data.
DELETE /users/123 → Clearly means deleting the user.
2. Security Concerns
GET should be safe → It should not modify data.
If DELETE is performed via GET (GET /deleteUser/123), a simple page refresh or a search engine crawling your API could accidentally delete data.
Proper methods prevent unintended actions.
3. Caching & Performance Optimization
GET requests can be cached by browsers and servers, improving performance.
If DELETE were a GET request, caches might store it and cause unintended deletions when reloaded.
4. Standards & Best Practices
Web frameworks, API clients, and security tools expect standard methods.
Many firewalls and proxies block non-GET methods unless explicitly allowed.
5. Idempotency & Safety
GET is idempotent → No matter how many times you request the same resource, the result is the same.
DELETE is idempotent but modifies data, so it should be explicitly defined.
Conclusion
While it may technically be possible to perform DELETE operations using GET, it is a bad practice because it introduces security risks, performance issues, and violates RESTful API principles. Following the correct method ensures clarity, safety, and maintainability

### Why Does Idempotency Matter?
- Avoids unintended side effects when APIs are called multiple times (e.g., due to retries).
- Improves reliability in case of network failures.
- Helps caching mechanisms (e.g., GET requests can be cached).
