ARP(address resolution protocol)
Why ARP?
# When you know the IP address but what if you don’t know the destination MAC address which is most of the situation 

# we use DNS to get the IP address , when you know IP address buy you dont  know the MAC address , in order to map ip address to MAC address that’s why we need ARP 


# we need the MAC address to send the frames (layer 2)
# Most of the time we know the IP address but not the MAC
# ARP table is cached representation that maps IP address to Mac 

Network Frame 
A and B are in the same network A want to send the GET/ request to B

A :
IP : 10.0.0.2
MAC : aa:nm:23:7f:c0:07

B:
IP 10.0.0.3
MAC : bb:ab:dd:11:22:33
Port 8080

GET/ (get request )
GET/8080   this is the port layer 4 segment 
GET/8080 10.0.0.3       destination port 
2312 GET/ 8080 10.0.0.3  2312 some random source port 
10.0.0.2 2312 GET/ 8080 10.0.0.3     source IP address

But this is not enough , this is layer 3, since in the same network switches can switch it will need the MAC address 

aa:nm:23:7f:c0:07  10.0.0.2 2312 GET/ 8080 10.0.0.3    bb:ab:dd:11:22:33


Shorter format 

aa 2 GET/  3 bb

Lets see with a example 

# A  Wants to send the GET/ request it will have destination port destination IP address something like this aa 2 GET/  3 but it doesn’t have the destination MAC address , how do we know that 

# IP 10.0.0.2 wants to connect to IP 10.0.0.3
# Host 2 checks if host 3 is in the same subnet , which is 
#  Host 2 needs the MAC address of host 3
# Host 2 checks its ARP table and its not there(it will check if it ever visited host 3) if not there then
# Host 2 sends an ARP request broadcast to all machines in its network
# who has IP address 10.0.0.3
# everyone in the network gets it host 3 , who has the IP address 3 , sp # host 3 will replies it him so , immediately ARP table is updated and insert it into IP packet 
# next time 2 want to connect to 3 then it doesn’t need ARP request 

Lets take another example ,

# if 10.0.0.3 (x) is not in the same subnet 
# Host 2 checks if the target is in same subnet , it is not 
# Host 2 needs to talk it gateway
# to connect we need the MAC address (how do. We get it we do the ARP request )
# now suppose gateway IP is 10.0.0.1(1) then it will ask which 1 then tell me MAC address , but this is dangerous someone in the same subnet can answer it or fake itself then all the packet will go to that machine 

Attacks can be performed on ARP (ARP poisoning)
