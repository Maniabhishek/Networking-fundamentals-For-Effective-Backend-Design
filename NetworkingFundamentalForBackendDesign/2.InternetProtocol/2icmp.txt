ICMP(Internet control message protocol)

# Stands for Internet messages 
# Designed for informational messages 
	## Host unreachable , port unreachable , fragmentation needed 
	## packet expired (infinite loop in router
# Uses IP directly 
# PING and trace route use it 
# Doesn’t require listeners or PORTS to be opened 

# some firewalls block ICMP for security reasons 
# That is why PING might not work in those cases 
# Disabling ICMP also can cause real damage with connection establishment 
	## fragmentation needed
# ping   google.com

For example sometime you find out that your IP packet is dropped because it had ICMP because firewall has blocked ICMP

Traceroute 
# you can identify the entire path your IP packet takes 
# clever use of TTL
# Increment TTL slowly and you will get the router IP address for each hop
# Doesn’t always work as path changes and ICMP might be blocked 

For example you can check “traceroute google.com”

It is IP level protocol , that is used to send information back and forth , but some firewall blocks it ,
if it block it means you can’t send the critical messages , you can get into wierd situation , ping , traceroute 
uses it ,you won’t get the important information like fragmentation needed , port unreachable
