DNS: (Domain Name System)

Why DNS 
# people can't remember IPs
# A domain is a text points to an IP or a collection of IPs
# Additional layer of abstraction is good 
# IP can change while the domain remain
# We can serve the closest IP to a client reqeusting the same domain 
# Load Balancing 

www.abc.com

www => subdomain 
abc => actual domain
com => top level domain

# A new addressing system means we need a mapping. Meet DNS 
# If You have an IP and you need the MAC , we use ARP 
# But if you have the name and you need the IP , we use DNS to map name to the IP
# Built on top of UDP
# Port 53 , (reserved port for DNS)
# Many records (MX, TXT, A, CNAME)

How DNS Works 
# DNS resolver - frontend and cache 
# ROOT server - Hosts IPs of the ANS (this will not know but it will redirect to the one who will know is TLD )
# TOP level domain server - Hosts IPs of the ANS (after root server it will ask the TLD of the .com or .org whatever , then get me Authoritative name server that might have the answer, this is where you registered your domain)
# Authoritative Name server -  hosts the IP of the target server
