## Connection establishment is costly
- TCP three way handshake
- The further apart the peers, the slower it is to send segments
- slow start keeps the connection from reaaching its potential right away
- Congestion control and flow control limit that further
- Delayed and nigel alg. can further slow down
- Destroying the connection is also expensive


## Connection Pooling
- Most implementation database backends and reverse proxies use pooling
- Establish a bunch of TCP connection to the backend and keep them running
- Any request that comes to the backend use an already opened connection
- This way your connections will be warm and slow start would have already kicked in
- Don't close the connection unless you absolutely don't need it


## Eager Vs Lazy loading
- Depending on what pardigm you take , you can save on resources
- Eager Loading -> Load everything and keep it ready
  - start up is slow but requests will be served immediately
  - some apps send warm up data to kick in the slow start but be careful of bandwidth and scalability
- Lazy loading -> only load things on demand
  - start up is fast but reqeusts will suffer initially
