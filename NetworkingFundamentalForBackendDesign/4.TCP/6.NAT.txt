NAT (Network Address Translation)

As IPv4 has limit of 4 billion addresses , everyone is connected to the interne ,the problem 
remains how can we get more than 4 billion devices on the internet, one solution is IPv6 , 
with a new protocol we need to update all the routers and it's a huge job

How the WAN(wide area network) sees your internal devices

NAT 
# IPv4 is limited only 4 billion
# Private vs Public IP address 
# Eg., 192.168.x.x, 10.0.0.x is private not routable in the internet(any router see this 
address will drops the packet , it never routes it bnecause these are considered private and 
you assign it for private users only , they are used only in internal routers )
# Internal hosts can be assigned private addresses
# Only your router need public IP addresses
# Router need to translate requests (the router can translate requests to and from it back to 
the device that originated through the magic of NAT)


Lets see with an example ,
Device A 192.168.1.2 wants to send to B 192.168.1.4 , both are connected to the same network 
192.168.1.1 , 

Get Request =>>> 8992|192.168.1.2|Get/|192.168.1.4|8080
Response, you get the pakcet ,literally flip everything 8080|192.168.1.4|JSON|192.168.1.2|8992

#Lets change the scenario 
Device A 192.168.1.2 wants to send to B 55.11.22.33 , B is not in the same network 
we have router with 192.168.1.1 (private) and 44.11.5.17 (public IP address)

#after applying the subnet masking it finds out target is not in the same subnet , it will 
send to the router , frame goes to the router but destination IP doesn't change , router will 
not send with the same source IP as it is private because if it sends it will be dropped 
before it reaches the server , so router is going to rewrite the IP packet with it public 44.
11.5.17 , now one would ask how will it reach to the correct source as correct source was 192.
168.1.2 , well , NAT is statefull , it remembers the source IP address , creates mapping for 
it so once the reqeust is made the IP packet will look like :
7777|44.11.5.17 |Get/|55.11.22.33|8080, , server receives it , processes it , written for 
JSON doc, then the ip packet will be flipped in the response 8080|55.11.22.33 |JSON|44.11.5.
17|7777 , router receives the packet it checks if this is for router itself , almost never 
the only time router receives an actual packet that is actually for that router is when admin 
want to manager the router , something like if you want to change the password or something 
related to the WiFi, otherwise router is never the final destination , router check the NAT 
table , and finds out to whom this response is going , router here in NAT mode it actually 
plays both role layer 3 and layer 4 , NAT will rewrite the Ip and port and that's how it will 
reach to the exact client who made the request 


# what is the maximum records in the NAT table when machine A wnat to send request B , (fixed 

source and destination )
if we fix the sosurce IP address and destination Ip address , then in this case 
only the source port is variable , then in that case you can only make 65000 connections 
(port is 16 bit), becasue 
only that much NAT can do mapping , this time other users will also be starved 

NAT Application
# Private to Public Translation (so we don't run out IPv4)
# Port forwarding 
    ## Add a NAT entry in the router to forward packets to 80 to a machine in your LAN 
    ## No need to have root access to listen on port 80 on your device 
    ## expose your local we server publically 
# Layer 4 load balancer 
    ## HAProxy NAT mode- your load balancer is your gateway 
    ## client send a reqeust to a bogus service IP
    ## Router intercepts that packet and replaces the service IP with a destination server 
    ## Layer 4 reverse proxying
