TCP Segment
 refer this for more clarity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#:~:text=A%20TCP%20segment%20consists%20of,data%20carried%20for%20the%20application.)

 # TCP segment header is 20 bytes and can go upto 60 bytes
 # TCP segments slides into an IP packet as data
 # Port are 16 bit (0 to 65535) (source 16 and destination 16)
 # Sequences , acknowledge , flow control and more 

IN TCP segment source and destination port gets 16 bits each 

Sequence Number get 24 bits which means around 4 billion so , you can sending the segments but at the end it has limit 

Window size : which is 16 bit around 65kilobytes that means server cannot handle segements after this , thats too low right ,
but its size can be increased

Maximum Segment size
# Segment size depends the MTU of the network
# Usually 512 bytes can go up to 1460
# Default MTU in the internet is 1500 (results in MSS 1460)
# Jumbo frames MTU goes to 9000 or more 
# MSS can be larger in jumbo frames cases
