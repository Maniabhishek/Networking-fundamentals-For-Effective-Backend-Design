CONGESTION CONTROL (How much the network can handle)

# the receiver might handle the load but the middle boxes might not 
# the routers in the middle have limit 
# We dont want to congest the network with data 
# We need to avoid congestion 
# A new window: Congestion window (CWND)

this is property for sender because sender is responsible for congestion.


 TCP Congestion Alogrithms 
 # TCP slow start (increases exponentially )
   > Start slow goes fast!
   > CWND + 1 MSS after each ACK 
# Congestion Avoidance 
   > Once slow start reaches its threshold this kicks in 
   > CWND + 1 MSS after complete RTT (round trip time)
# CWND must not exceeds RWND 

SLOW START 
# CWND start with 1 MSS (or more)
# Send 1 segment and waits for ACK
# with each ACK received, CWND is incremented by 1 MSS
# Until we reach slow start threshhold we switch to congestion avoidance alogrithm

example: 
A sends 1 segment to B then B send ACK , Now A will increase CWND by 1 now A will send 2 segments now B will send ACK for these 2 segments ACK2 , ACK3 although , it will send only one ACK3 (which means anything above ACK3 is also received) thus CWND will be increased by 1 and another 1 for another ACK ie., ACK2 now A will send 4 segments ,
so it is increasing like 1 then 2 then 4 ....it increases exponentially , once it reaches slow start threshold we switch to the congestion avoidance alogrithm , in case of avoidance alogrithm we just increase CWND by 1 in one round trip which means when B sends ACK let's say for 7 segments then it will increase by 1 , so in this algorithm it almost becomes linear,
even if you receive one acknowledgement for the 8th one , that's one round trip 

CONGESTION AVOIDANCE
# Send CWND worth of segments and waits for ACK
# Only when all segments are ACKed add up to 1 MSS to CWND
# Precisely CWND = CWND + MSS*/CWND(its not exactly added by but roughly , this , less than 1)

Congestion Notification
# We dont want router dropping packets 
# can Router let us know when congestion hit 
# meet ECN (Explicit congestion Notification)
# Routers and middle boxes can tag IP packets with ECN
# The receiver will copy this bit back to the sender
# ECN is IP header bit
# So routers don't drop packets just le me know you are reaching your limit

Sender can send segments up to CWND or RWND without ACK  (RWND Without ACK because you dont want to wait for the ACK each time , it will make it slow)
