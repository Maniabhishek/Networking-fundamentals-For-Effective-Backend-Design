## Delayed Acknowledgments (Less packets are good but performace is better)
***
Nagel's Algorithm and Delayed ack were developed at same time, if both are disabled at the same time , it will be lot of delay, nagels algorithm don't send the packet until segment is full and wait for the ack and delayed ack is also enabled just imagine delay at both side will increase the latency by a lot

### Delayed Acknowledgment Algorithm 
*** 
- It is waste to acknowledge every segments right away
- we can wait little more to recieve more segment and ack once
-  A sends segment1 and segment2 to B and again sends segment 3 and 4 , and again send segment5 to B it waits once it has received more segments or all segments , this is where it causes the delay


### Problem with delayed ACK
***
- Causes delays in some clients that may lead to timeout and retransmission
- Noticeable performance degradation
- Combined with nagle's algorithm can lead to 400ms delays
- Each party is waiting on each other


### Disabling Delayed acknowledgments algorithm 
***
- disbale delayed ack algorithm can be done with TCP_QUICKACK option
- Segments will be acknowledged "quicker"
