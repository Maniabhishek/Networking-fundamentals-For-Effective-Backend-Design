# Nagle's Algorithm

## Nagle Algorightm 
> - In the telnet days sending byte in a segment is a waste (even when sending single byte they had to send the 40 Bytes header(segment with 20 bytes and IP with 20 bytes))
     **(to overcome this problem of 40 bytes overhead , just wait until client fills the segment and this causes some delay)**
> - combine small segments and send them in a single one 
> - The client can wait for a full MSS before sending the segment 
> - There is No wasted 40 bytes header (IP + TCP) for a few bytes of data 
>> - Let's understand with an example assume MSS = 1460, A sends 500 bytes , 500 < 1460 client(the one who sends the data) waits to fill the segment if there isn't anything to ACK data will be immediately sent, so filling the remaining data with 1460 byte or it waits during that period is what causes delay (this delay only happens when there is some data that needs to be acknolwedged , otherwise data is sent immediately for example if i have to send 500 bytes no data has to be acknoledged then it will be sent immediately)
>> - sending large data casuses delay A wants to send the 5000 byte of data on 1460 MSS , then 3 packet will have 1460*3 segments fit into 3 packets what about the remaing one 620 byte of data 4th segment is not sent , 4th not full segment are only sent when an ack is received only after that 620 segment will be sent , so more the latency between A and B large the delay , so to remove this delay either disable this nagel algorithm or fill segment 

## Disabling Nagle's algorithm 
> - Most client today disable Nagle's algorithm (by client whoever send the data , be it client or server)
> - I rather get performace than small bandwidth 
> - TCP_NODELAY


## summary 
> Nagels algorithm was designed to wait when you are a sender , whether client or server , you wait for a full packet worth of MSS while we have a acknowledgement , if i dont have any data in transit then send it immediately
