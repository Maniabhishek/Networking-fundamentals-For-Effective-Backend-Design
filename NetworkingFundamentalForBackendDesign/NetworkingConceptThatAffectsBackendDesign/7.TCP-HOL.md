## TCP Head of line blocking
- TCP order packets in the order they are sent
- The segments are not acknowledged or delivered to the app until they are in order
- This is great but what if multiple clients are using the same connection
  - For example , if client is sending segment 1,2,3,4 and server received only 2,3,4 then client has to resend the segment 1, or the entire segment , unless the selective acknowledgment where it will say (received 2, 3, 4 ), then client will know to send 1st packet ,
  - but what if multiple client are using the same conneciton what do we do?
    - HTTP request may use the same connection to send multiple reqeusts
    - Request 1 is segments 1, 2
    - Request 2 is segments 3, 4
    - segment 2,3,4 is arrived but 1 is lost?
    - Request 2 technically was delivered but TCP is blocking it
    - Huge latency in apps, big problem in HTTP/2 with streams
    - QUIC solves this
   

> TCP request 1 with segment 3,4 was delivered and request 2 with 1,2 segment where 1 is not being sent , then whole thing is blcoked , response will be blocked and thus huge latency, this is one major problem , because we use the same TCP Connection , (take request as streams), and each stream is technically independent from each other, TCP is just a blob of streaming data , it doesn't have context , so as a result it end up blocking and this is called the TCP Head of line blocking, this was major problem in HTTP2 which was solved in HTTP3 and QUIC effectively
