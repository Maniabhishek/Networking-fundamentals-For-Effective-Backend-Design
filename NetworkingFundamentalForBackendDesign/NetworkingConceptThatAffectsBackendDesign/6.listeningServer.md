## Listening
- you create a server by listening on a port on a specific port on a specific IP address
  - one might say why to select IP address , my machine should have only one IP address, no that's not right your machine will have multiple IP addresses , localhost, one is 0.0.0.0 whoch literally tells the host that i want to listen to everything
  - and third one is the actual IP address which is whatever it is that connects you to the internet be it wifi , or ethernet, you could have docker installed and thats a bridges network adapter, so you can have many  IP addresses, so when you listen you better know what you are listening on.
  - Let's look at bug  
- your machine might have multiple interfaces with multiple IP address
- listen (127.0.0.1, 8080) -> listens on the local host (localhost just the DNS entery) ipV4 interface on port 8080
- listens (::1, 8080) listens on localhost ipv6 interface on port 8080
- listen (192.168.1.2, 8080) -> listens on 192.168.1.2 on port 8080
- listen (0.0.0.0, 8080) -> listens on all interfaces on port 8080 (this means any other IP address can make request to this server)
- You can have only one process in a host listening on IP/Port
- No two process can listen on the same port
- P1 -> Listen (127.0.0.1, 8080)
- P2 -> Listen (127.0.0.1, 8080) error


## Exception
- There is a configuration that allows more than one process to listen on the same root
- SO_PORTREUSE (socket option port reuse)
- operating systems balance segments among process (not entirely true)
- os creates a hash source ip/surce port/dest ip/dest port
- Guarantees always go to the same process if the Pair match
  - the Operating system introduced the ability to listen on the same port by different processes.
  - what OS will do is load balance connections to the right process, (so it will actually do load balancing)
 
## Example:
- Lets say App1-Port-5555 and App2-port-3456 from host A tries to send request to AppX-Port-8080 and AppY-Port-8080 (since it is the same port how will the request goes to correct appp)
- it will do hashing IP/source port/dest app , and will find out the correct server
- there was bug reported in LINUX , if the process stops , then hash table changes ,and it will cause issue
