# TCP Fast Open (TFO)
> I can send data during handshake
> In tcp handshake we send syn ack , and these packets are empty , there is nothing in them , it's just a single bit if you look at the TCP header (layer 4 heder),


## Handshake is slow.
> - we know that the handshake is slow
> - I already know the server i have established a connection prior
> - can we use a predetermined token to send data immediately during the handshake ? Yes with TFO

## TFO 
> - client and server establishes connection 1, server sends an encrypted cookie
> - client store the TFO cookie
> - client want to create another connection
> - client sends SYN, data and TFO cookie in TCP options
> - Server authenticate the cookie and sends response + SYN/ACK
>> - now in this case when we add TFO , its more that 20 byte header, the server authenticate the cookie and sends back the response (the response will include the SYN ACK which is the part of the handshake).
>> - so what comes immediately after the TCP connection , its TLS (the one that establishes the encryption) , so most TFO data is TLS, so if we are able to send this TLS data at first then we will be able to save time(by few millisecond)

- TFO is by default enabled in linux 3.13 >
- You can enable TFO in curl --tcp-fastopen
- Goes without saying , you still get TCP slow start with TCP Fast Open
- You can take advantage of this feature to send early data
