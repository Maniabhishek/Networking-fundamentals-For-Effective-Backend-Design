## Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancers
- You can replace load balancer with reverse proxies and it will be identical effectively.
- A load balancer is a reverse proxy is just a case of reverse proxy that happens to have a logic to balance the request between multiple backends on the backend, while a reverse proxies just doesn't have to balance it, it makes request on your behalf. It just talks to a backend but it doesn't have to have balancing logic necessarily.
- so every load balancer is a reverse proxy but not every reverse proxy will be load balancer


## Layer 4 Load Balancer
- assume if we have a load balancer which connects two backend server 1, and 2 , opens a connection and warms it up with load balancer , now client want to make a request to server , and it will establish a connection1 it will make request to LB(load balancer), and and with same connection to server 1 for example , all the segment that clients send for any request in that connection will go to same backend server which was choosen in that connection .
- Request can be anything it can http, gRPC , web sockets , mysql connection , because in the end it is just pure TCP connection after all, this is the benefit in layer 4 load balancer, it can accept any request, because its just data , which is just segments


## Layer 4 Load Balancer (Pros and cons)
- Pros
  - Simpler load balancing
  - Efficient (no data lookup , maybe in some scenario)
  - more secure
  - Works with any protocol
  - One TCP connection (NAT)
- Cons
  - No smart load balancing , because data is not visible so you can't decide the backend based on data , you can maxium do is change the port, as port is visible in layer 4 and can switch backend efficiently(can only play around with ports and IP addresses)
  -  NA microservices , you would need smarter logic although you can only obviously use the idea of ports and IP addresses
  -  Sticky per connection (all the segments that yous end on the connection will always go to one server and only one connection, there is no load balancing per connection )
  -  No caching (because we dont know what's in there, we cannot cache it)
  -  Protocol unaware (can be dangerous) bypass rules



## Layer 7 Load balancer 
- when a client connects to the L7 load balancer, it becomes protocol specific. Any logical "request" will be forwarded to a new backend server. This could be one or more segments
