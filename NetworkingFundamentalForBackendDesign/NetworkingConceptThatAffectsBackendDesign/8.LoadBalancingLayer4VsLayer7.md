## Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancers
- You can replace load balancer with reverse proxies and it will be identical effectively.
- A load balancer is a reverse proxy is just a case of reverse proxy that happens to have a logic to balance the request between multiple backends on the backend, while a reverse proxies just doesn't have to balance it, it makes request on your behalf. It just talks to a backend but it doesn't have to have balancing logic necessarily.
- so every load balancer is a reverse proxy but not every reverse proxy will be load balancer


## Layer 4 Load Balancer
- assume if we have a load balancer which connects two backend server 1, and 2 , opens a connection and warms it up with load balancer , now client want to make a request to server , and it will establish a connection1 it will make request to LB(load balancer), and and with same connection to server 1 for example , all the segment that clients send for any request in that connection will go to same backend server which was choosen in that connection .
- Request can be anything it can http, gRPC , web sockets , mysql connection , because in the end it is just pure TCP connection after all, this is the benefit in layer 4 load balancer, it can accept any request, because its just data , which is just segments


## Layer 4 Load Balancer (Pros and cons)
- Pros
  - Simpler load balancing
  - Efficient (no data lookup , maybe in some scenario)
  - more secure
  - Works with any protocol
  - One TCP connection (NAT)
- Cons
  - No smart load balancing , because data is not visible so you can't decide the backend based on data , you can maxium do is change the port, as port is visible in layer 4 and can switch backend efficiently(can only play around with ports and IP addresses)
  -  NA microservices , you would need smarter logic although you can only obviously use the idea of ports and IP addresses
  -  Sticky per connection (all the segments that yous end on the connection will always go to one server and only one connection, there is no load balancing per connection )
  -  No caching (because we dont know what's in there, we cannot cache it)
  -  Protocol unaware (can be dangerous) bypass rules



## Layer 7 Load balancer 
- when a client connects to the L7 load balancer, it becomes protocol specific. Any logical "request" will be forwarded to a new backend server. This could be one or more segments
- when a client make request , goest to load balancer , and it will choose the backend based on the data provided , it need to read the data , in order to read it, it will try to decrypt the data , to decode the data , you have to have a connection between you and the server and also, a secure connection between you and server, that means you ever want to host your website, this certificate has to live in the layer seven load balancer in this case or otherwise, how can load balancer pretend to be your website , this load balancer has to pretend to be your website right, becuase that the final destination for client, so you have to give it the TLS certificate, so it has to decrypt then read
- so lets understand it with an example, client A establishes connection to LB, and LB has already connecition established with 2 backends 1, and 2, then client makes a request 1 and send 3 segment 1,2,3 all these 3 segments will go the LB and it will decide which backend should it go and lets say it sends to backend 1 all the segment will go to one backend server in that request , if another request is made and again if it want to send segment 1,2,3 , now this is completely a new request now when it comes to LB , now for example it sends the request to backend 2 , then in that reqeust all the segment will go to backend 2 , now this is where **HTTP Smuggling** happens , HTTP smuggling happend when load balancer and backend server do not agree on where their request start and where they end.
- Once someone connects and Reserves that connection, that back end connection cannot be used for any of the clients. that's, I guess, another disadvantage, **layer 4 load balancer** it becomes a private connection So that's a big disadvantage actually in layer four, right, because you can deplete your back end connections

## PROS and Cons
- Pros
  - smart load balancing
  - caching
  - great for microservices
  - API gateway logic
  - Authentication
- Cons
  - Expensive
  - Decrypts (terminate TLS)
  - Two tcp connections
  - must share TLS certificate
  - needs to buffer (it will read read read , and then send the request to backend , can become bottleneck)
  - Needs to understand protocol  (cannot understand the all the protocol , because we are reading the data , parsing the data if we dont understand how to communicate to the backend, then we are done , in this case layer 4 can be used)
