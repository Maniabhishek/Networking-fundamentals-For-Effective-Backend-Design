Communication between Hosts

=> I need to send a message from HOST A to HOST B 
=> Usually a request to do something on B (RPC)
=> Each host network card has a unique Media Access Control address

=> A send a message to B specifying the MAC address 
=> for example there are 4 host connected to the network , each one of them will get the message but only B will accept it ,
all the host will go until layer 2 data link layer checks the MAC address and dedicated host will accept it will proceed with further layers

=> Imagine millions of machines 
=> We need a way to eliminate the need to send it to everyone 
=> The address need to get better 
=> We need to route , need the  IP address

For example one would say ,why do you need ip address MAC address is unique just send me directly , why to send to anyone else , 
but that is not possible , it would be like scanning in way too many devices to find out the correct one 

=> The IP address is build in two parts (4 bytes)
=> One part to identify the network , the other is the host 
=> We use the network portion to eliminate many networks 
=> the host part is used to find the host 
=> Still needs MAC addresses!

Lets understand it with an example 
For example under 193.192.1 IP has 3 host(A,B,C) and  192.234.1 IP has 3 another host (A,B,C) 

A from one network wants to communicate to B , then it is the router wich will connect two network together and will connect it to B 

Router is 3 layer device which needs to see the IP address , it has two parts and which helps selecting target network  and device 

But host will have many apps 
=> Its not enough just to address the host 
=> The host is running many apps each with different requirements
=> Meets ports 
=> You can send an HTTP request on port 80 , a DNS request on PORT53 and an SSH request on PORT 22 all running on the same server
