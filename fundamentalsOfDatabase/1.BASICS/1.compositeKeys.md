### What is a Composite Key?
- A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns to uniquely identify a record in a table.
- ðŸ‘‰ It is used when a single column is not sufficient to ensure uniqueness.

## Problem:
- Student_ID alone cannot be the primary key because a student can enroll in multiple courses.
- Course_ID alone cannot be the primary key because multiple students can enroll in the same course.

Solution â€“ Using a Composite Key
We define a composite primary key (Student_ID, Course_ID):

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student_Course_Enrollment (
    Student_ID INT,
    Course_ID INT,
    Enrollment_Date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (Student_ID, Course_ID) -- Composite Key
);
```

## Why?
- (Student_ID, Course_ID) together ensures uniqueness, meaning a student cannot enroll in the same course twice.
- Enrollment_Date depends on both Student_ID and Course_ID, maintaining 2NF.

## Key Takeaways
- âœ… A composite key consists of multiple columns to uniquely identify records.
- âœ… It is useful in many-to-many relationships like students & courses.
- âœ… A single column primary key may not always be sufficient to enforce uniqueness.
