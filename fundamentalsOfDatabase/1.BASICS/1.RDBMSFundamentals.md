### Normalization & Denormalization
## Normalization helps reduce redundancy and improve integrity.
- 1NF (First Normal Form) â†’ No duplicate rows, atomic values (no arrays/lists).
- 2NF (Second Normal Form) â†’ No partial dependencies (every column depends on the whole primary key).
- 3NF (Third Normal Form) â†’ No transitive dependencies (non-key columns should not depend on other non-key columns).
- BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) â†’ Stricter version of 3NF, ensuring all functional dependencies have a superkey.


## Lets understand the 2NF
- It is already in First Normal Form (1NF) (i.e., no duplicate rows, atomic columns).
- It has no partial dependency, meaning every non-key column should depend on the entire primary key, not just a part of it.

## Understanding Partial Dependency
- A partial dependency occurs when a non-key column depends on only part of a composite primary key.
- ðŸ‘‰ Composite Primary Key: A primary key made up of two or more columns.

## Example â€“ Table Violating 2NF
Let's consider a Student_Course table:
<img width=400 height=400 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/140a1420-36d9-42e2-b38a-390cbeaa9881" >

- Primary Key: (Student_ID, Course_ID) (Composite Key)
## Issue:
- Student_Name depends only on Student_ID.
- Course_Name and Instructor depend only on Course_ID.
- These are partial dependencies, violating 2NF.

## Converting to 2NF
- To remove partial dependencies, we split the table into two:
- Student Table (Depends only on Student_ID)
- Student course table should only depend on course_id
