A table is in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) if:
- It is already in Third Normal Form (3NF).
- Every determinant is a candidate key.


- ðŸ‘‰ A determinant is any column (or set of columns) that uniquely determines another column.
- ðŸ‘‰ A candidate key is a minimal key that uniquely identifies every row in a table.
- ðŸ“Œ BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF, used when 3NF still allows redundancy due to multiple candidate keys.

## Example â€“ Table Violating BCNF
  Consider a Professor_Course table:

<img width=800 height=200 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17a4bb98-51fc-47a9-8075-7dcea09cee02">

## Candidate Keys: (Professor, Course)
- Determinant: Professor â†’ Department (Each professor belongs to only one department).
- Issue: Professor is a determinant, but not a candidate key.
- This violates BCNF since every determinant must be a candidate key.

## Converting to BCNF
To fix this, we split the table:
<img width=800 height=200 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20ccb09-5885-4dac-8d4c-1d7844c31cc9">

Course Table:

<img width=800 height=200 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cc51bea-6f88-42c5-851b-ef9e4db2e402">

Now, every determinant is a candidate key, making the database BCNF-compliant.

## Consider a room booking system 

<img width=800 height=200 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb29030a-37ee-412c-8649-19aa05b87fe3">

## Functional Dependencies:
- (Room_No â†’ Department) (Each room belongs to only one department)
- (Staff_ID â†’ Staff_Name, Department) (Each staff belongs to one department)

## Candidate Key(s):
- (Room_No, Staff_ID) â†’ Uniquely identifies a booking.
Issue (BCNF Violation):

Room_No determines Department, but Room_No is not a candidate key.
This means Room_No is a determinant but not a candidate key, violating BCNF.

## How to Fix It? (BCNF Conversion)
- We split the table into two tables:
1. Room Table (To store which department a room belongs to)
