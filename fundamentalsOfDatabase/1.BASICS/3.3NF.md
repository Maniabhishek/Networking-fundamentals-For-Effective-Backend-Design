### A table is in Third Normal Form (3NF) if:
- It is already in Second Normal Form (2NF) (i.e., no partial dependencies).
- It has no transitive dependency, meaning non-key columns should not depend on other non-key columns.

## Understanding Transitive Dependency
- A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key column depends on another non-key column instead of directly depending on the primary key.

## ðŸ‘‰ Example of Transitive Dependency:
- A studentâ€™s department name depends on the Department_ID, not directly on the Student_ID

## Example â€“ Table Violating 3NF
Consider a Student table:

<img width=800 height=200 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad21c98d-99de-421d-99a2-c9b29aa04763">

- Primary Key: Student_ID
## Problem:
- Department_Name depends on Department_ID, not directly on Student_ID.
- This is a transitive dependency, violating 3NF.


## Converting to 3NF
- To remove the transitive dependency, we split the table into two:
- Student Table (No Transitive Dependency)


<img width=800 height=200 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90c4231c-42fa-4a52-a56b-6b88ce48accf">

Department Table

<img width=800 height=200 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c2afc2a-279e-495e-bd3b-68c955facd9d">

Why is this now in 3NF?

Every column depends only on the primary key.
Department_Name is now properly linked to Department_ID instead of being dependent on Student_ID.
