### A table is in Third Normal Form (3NF) if:
- It is already in Second Normal Form (2NF) (i.e., no partial dependencies).
- It has no transitive dependency, meaning non-key columns should not depend on other non-key columns.

## Understanding Transitive Dependency
- A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key column depends on another non-key column instead of directly depending on the primary key.
- ðŸ‘‰ Example of Transitive Dependency:
- A studentâ€™s department name depends on the Department_ID, not directly on the Student_ID
