Definition:
A candidate key is a minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row in a table.
- ðŸ‘‰ A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one is chosen as the primary key.
- ðŸ‘‰ A candidate key must be minimal, meaning no extra columns should be included in it.

## Student Table

Candidate Keys:
âœ… Student_ID (Uniquely identifies each student)
âœ… Email (Each email is unique)
âœ… Phone (Each phone number is unique)

## Primary Key Choice:
- We can choose any one of the candidate keys as the primary key.
- Example: If we choose Student_ID as the primary key, Email and Phone remain candidate keys.

## Characteristics of Candidate Keys
- âœ” Unique â€“ No two rows can have the same value for a candidate key.
- âœ” Minimal â€“ No extra attributes should be included.
- âœ” Can serve as a Primary Key â€“ One candidate key is chosen as the Primary Key.

## Candidate Key vs. Primary Key vs. Super Key
- Super Key:	A set of attributes that uniquely identify a row (May have extra attributes).
- Candidate Key: A minimal super key (No extra attributes).
- Primary Key: The chosen candidate key to uniquely identify records.

## In above table 
Super Keys:
- âœ… (Student_ID)
- âœ… (Email)
- âœ… (Phone)
- âœ… (Student_ID, Email) (Not minimal, so not a candidate key)
- âœ… (Student_ID, Phone) (Not minimal, so not a candidate key)

Candidate Keys:
- âœ… (Student_ID)
- âœ… (Email)
- âœ… (Phone)

- Candidate Keys: (Professor, Course) both together can uniquely find the row
